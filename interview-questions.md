# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A peramiter is a placeholder in a function and does not have a real value. An argument is the concrete value passed into a function.

Researched answer: Arguments fill in the placeholder of the peramiter with a concrete valuable to envoke a function. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The built in Javascript .map() method accept 3 peramiters : value, index, and array. While value is required as atleast one argument, it can also accept index and array as optional arguments if these are needed to envoke the higher order function.

Researched answer: The JS .map() function is a built in array method that can have up to three arguments. Value is a required peramiter while index and array are optional peramiters. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: HWile both .map() and .filter() are arrya methods, they behave in different ways based on their uses. .map() iterates an array and passes the function through the entire array. .filter() iterates an array and passes the function through only what meets certain criteria outlined i nthe function. 

Researched answer: While both .map() and .filter() functions create new arrays of elements while (usually) applying a function to the original array elements, the .filter only returns elements where the specified function returns the boolean true for the function argument. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is to go through one piece at a time and apply the function to each specified piece. 

Researched answer: Iterators are a method of "traversing" an array to better access each element in an array dynamically. 

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: An object is anything that has a key; value pair in Javascript. Any key;value pair is an object. A class is used as a template to create objects more easily and dynamically using a function. 

Researched answer: Classes are special functions with two components: expression and declaration. Once a class is created, a function can then be used to create an object (a key:value pair). 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: What an excellent question! I haven't come accross that term before in relation to JavaScript. I will need to more thoroughly research an answer for you and will get back to you  with an answer as soon as I can. 

Researched answer: Functions can be declared before defined, while classes must be defined before they are declared. Hoisting refers to moving the declaration to the top of scope before a code is actually executed. This is done automatically for functions, but for classes can (and usually does0 produce a reference error. )

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: User stories are a way developers plan thier work to better simplify the needs of the user and the functionality desired by the user. 

2. Spread operator: A spread operator uses an existing function call to expand an existing argument or element. For classes, using new before the class calls it to add the new object key:value pair(s). 

3. React: REACT is a javascript library for building user interfaces that shortens the code and time needed to build web pages. It is free and open source for anyone's use. 

4. React props: React props are the equivilent of the inputs for React that return JS code. 

5. DOM events: DOM stands for document object methods that can be used to iterate HTML functions.
